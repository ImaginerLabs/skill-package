description: >-
  Comprehensive pre-commit review of git staged changes. Performs tech-stack-aware code quality checks and generates
  conventional commit messages. Should be used when the user is about to commit code and wants a quality gate —
  catching debug leftovers, sensitive data, missing error handling before they enter the repository.
  Distinguished from frontend-code-review which reviews general code quality, this skill focuses specifically
  on git staged changes pre-commit.

# Git Staged Code Review

## Core Capability

Before `git commit`, review all staged changes for quality issues and generate a conventional commit message. This is the last quality gate — catching problems here is far cheaper than finding them in production or during PR review.

## When to Use

- The last quality checkpoint before `git commit`
- When linking requirement IDs, Story IDs to commit records
- Tech-stack-differentiated code checks in multi-stack projects
- Local checks before CI/CD pipeline

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Staged Diff

```bash
git diff --staged
git diff --staged --name-only
```

**Pre-check**: If staging area is empty, prompt the user to run `git add` first.

### Step 2: Identify Tech Stack

Auto-detect based on changed file extensions and content:

| File signature                                     | Tech stack         | Applied rules                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `*.tsx` / `*.jsx` / `*.ts` / `*.js` + React import | React / TypeScript | Stale closures, Hook deps, render performance |
| `*.vue`                                            | Vue                | Reactive traps, lifecycle side effects        |
| `*.go`                                             | Go                 | Error handling, goroutine leaks               |
| `*.py`                                             | Python             | Exception handling, type annotations          |
| `*.java` / `*.kt`                                  | Java / Kotlin      | Null pointers, resource release               |
| `*.rs`                                             | Rust               | Ownership, lifetimes                          |

### Step 3: Execute Code Review

#### Universal Checks

- **Debug code**: Leftover `console.log`, `debugger`, `print`, unhandled `TODO`
- **Sensitive data**: Hardcoded passwords, tokens, keys, internal addresses
- **Comment quality**: Remove meaningless comments; complex logic must have explanatory comments
- **Error handling**: New async/IO operations must have error handling
- **Boundary conditions**: Null, empty arrays, extreme inputs must be guarded

#### React/TypeScript Specific Checks

- Hook dependency arrays complete (exhaustive-deps)
- Objects/functions passed to children wrapped in useMemo / useCallback
- useEffect has corresponding cleanup function
- List rendering key uses stable unique ID
- New Props have TypeScript type definitions

### Step 4: Parse User Parameters

| Parameter format    | Meaning           | Message example                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `--story=STORY-123` | Link Story ID     | `feat: xxx\n\nStory: STORY-123`           |
| `--task=TASK-456`   | Link Task ID      | `feat: xxx\n\nTask: TASK-456`             |
| `--fix=BUG-789`     | Link Bug ID       | `fix: xxx\n\nFixes: BUG-789`              |
| `--review`          | Force review mode | No auto-commit, only output review report |

### Step 5: Decide Next Steps Based on Review Results

| Conclusion                                  | Action                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Pass**: No blocking issues             | Generate commit message, ask user whether to commit |
| ⚠️ **Warning**: Suggestions but no blockers | List suggestions, ask user whether to proceed       |
| ❌ **Fail**: Blocking issues exist          | List must-fix issues, **do not commit**             |

**Blocking issues (must fix before commit):**

- Hardcoded passwords, tokens, private keys
- Leftover `debugger` statements
- Code that could cause security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, etc.)

## Commit Message Convention

Follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[body]

[footer]
```

**Type options:**

| type       | Use case                           | Example                                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature                        | `feat(user): add avatar upload`                |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                            | `fix(cart): fix quantity calculation error`    |
| `refactor` | Refactoring                        | `refactor(utils): refactor utility functions`  |
| `perf`     | Performance optimization           | `perf(list): optimize list render performance` |
| `style`    | Code formatting                    | `style: unify code indentation`                |
| `test`     | Testing                            | `test(user): add login unit tests`             |
| `chore`    | Build/toolchain/dependency updates | `chore: upgrade dependencies`                  |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes              | `docs: update API docs`                        |
