name: react-component-refactor
description: >-
  Analyzes React component structure, identifies reusable units, and refactors large or messy components into
  clean, well-organized code. Strictly maintains 1:1 logic equivalence — only structure changes, never behavior.
  Should be used when the user wants to refactor a React component — splitting a monolith, reorganizing a
  messy file, or restructuring for better maintainability.
  Distinguished from react-component-extraction which extracts specific reusable pieces, this skill
  restructures the entire component.

# React Component Refactoring

## Core Capability

Analyze existing code structure, identify reusable logic, and refactor according to React best practices. **Strictly preserve original logic intent** — only optimize and split at the structure level.

The difference from `react-component-extraction`: extraction pulls out a specific piece for reuse; refactoring restructures the entire component for clarity and maintainability. Think of extraction as surgery, refactoring as renovation.

## Workflow

```
1. Confirm refactoring scope and output directory
2. Analyze code structure (identify reusable units)
3. Design refactoring plan (seek confirmation)
4. Execute refactoring
5. Verify logic equivalence
```

## 1. Pre-refactoring Preparation

### Confirm User Input

| Info                  | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Refactoring scope** | File path or code snippet specified by user                                 |
| **Output directory**  | Where refactored files go (do not change without permission)                |
| **Refactoring goal**  | Expected outcome (e.g., split sub-components, extract Hooks, full refactor) |

### Code Structure Analysis

```
Analysis dimensions:
├── Component scale: total lines, JSX nesting depth
├── Responsibility identification: what different responsibilities does this component handle
├── Duplicate logic: similar JSX structures or logic patterns
├── State distribution: is state distribution reasonable
├── Side effects: number and clarity of useEffect responsibilities
└── Reusable units: what can become independent components or Hooks
```

---

## 2. Reusable Unit Identification Rules

### Identify as independent component when:

| Condition                                                        | Example                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| JSX structure exceeds 30 lines with relatively independent logic | Complex form sections, data display cards                   |
| Same structure appears 2+ times in the same file                 | Similar list items, repeated button groups                  |
| Has independent interaction state (expand/collapse)              | Collapsible panels, dropdown menus, modal triggers          |
| Can be used independently from current context                   | Generic Loading state, empty state placeholder, error block |

### Identify as custom Hook when:

| Condition                                                  | Example                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Contains 2+ related state values + useEffect               | Data fetching logic (loading + data + error)      |
| Same Hook combination used in multiple places              | Pagination logic, form validation logic           |
| Side effect logic not directly tied to UI rendering        | Event listeners, timers, WebSocket connections    |
| High complexity logic affecting main component readability | Complex filter/sort logic, permission check logic |

### Keep in original component when:

- Logic is simple (< 10 lines), splitting would increase cognitive overhead
- Highly coupled with parent state, splitting requires excessive props passing
- Used only once in current component with no reuse value

## 3. Refactoring Plan Design

**Present the plan to the user for confirmation before executing:**

```
Refactoring plan: [original filename]

Original file: src/pages/Order/index.tsx (320 lines)

Split plan:
├── 📦 OrderHeader.tsx        → Extract order header info display (original L12-L58)
├── 📦 OrderItemList.tsx      → Extract order item list (original L60-L130)
├── 🪝 useOrderDetail.ts      → Extract order data fetching logic
└── 📄 index.tsx              → Refactored main file (keep core orchestration logic)

Output directory: src/pages/Order/components/

Confirm execution?
```

## 4. Code Generation Standards

### TypeScript Type Standards

- Props interface must be explicitly defined, required/optional clearly distinguished
- Enums/unions prefer TypeScript native types

### Component Structure

Each component file organized in this order: `external imports → internal imports → type definitions → component implementation → exports`

### Custom Hook Standards

Hook returns use **object** format (when > 2 return values), including standard `data / loading / error / refetch` fields.

## 5. 1:1 Logic Preservation Guarantee

### Never change these:

| Prohibited change        | Why                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Business logic**       | Conditions, calculations, data processing must remain identical   |
| **Side effect timing**   | useEffect trigger timing and dependencies must not change         |
| **State initial values** | All state initial values must match original code                 |
| **Event handling logic** | Event callback execution logic must not be simplified or modified |
| **Render conditions**    | All conditional rendering logic must remain consistent            |
| **Props interface**      | Exposed Props signature must not have breaking changes            |

### Logic Equivalence Verification Checklist

- [ ] Conditional rendering: all &&, ternary conditions match original
- [ ] List rendering: map data source, key values, render content match original
- [ ] Event binding: all handler trigger conditions and execution logic unchanged
- [ ] Side effect dependencies: useEffect dependency arrays and trigger timing unchanged
- [ ] State flow: state update logic completely identical to original

### Difference Annotation

If original code has **obvious bugs or anti-patterns**, **do not fix them** — annotate and inform the user:

```typescript
// ⚠️ Note: original code uses index as key here, consider changing to item.id later
{items.map((item, index) => <Item key={index} data={item} />)}
```

## 6. React Best Practices Check

- All components use function components + Hooks
- Props interface defined in TypeScript
- Functions passed to child components wrapped in `useCallback`
- Objects/arrays passed to child components wrapped in `useMemo`
- Pure display sub-components wrapped in `React.memo`
- Async operations in useEffect use AbortController for unmount scenarios
- List rendering uses stable, unique business IDs as keys

## Output Format

```markdown
## React Component Refactoring Report

### Refactoring Overview

- **Original file**: `[original file path]` (X lines)
- **Output directory**: `[user-specified directory]`
- **Split file count**: X

### Split Results

| File           | Type                 | Original lines | Description                |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| ComponentA.tsx | Sub-component        | L12~L58        | Responsibility description |
| useXxx.ts      | Custom Hook          | L60~L90        | Responsibility description |
| index.tsx      | Refactored main file | —              | Core orchestration logic   |

### Logic Equivalence Verification

- [ ] Conditional rendering: ✅ Matches original
- [ ] List rendering: ✅ Key values and data source match
- [ ] Event binding: ✅ Trigger conditions and execution logic unchanged
- [ ] Side effect dependencies: ✅ useEffect dependency arrays unchanged
- [ ] State flow: ✅ State update logic completely identical

### Original Code Issues Found (annotated, not fixed)

- If none: ✅ No obvious bugs or anti-patterns found
```
