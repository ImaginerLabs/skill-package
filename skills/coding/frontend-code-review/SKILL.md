description: >-
  Comprehensive frontend code quality audit covering ESLint, robustness, side effects, and performance for
  React/Vue/Taro projects. Should be used when the user needs a thorough code quality check — before
  committing, during PR review, after refactoring, or when inheriting someone else's code.
  Distinguished from staged-code-review which focuses on git staged changes pre-commit, this skill
  focuses on general frontend code quality auditing.

# Frontend Code Quality Review

## Core Capability

Full-spectrum code health check for frontend code, ensuring production-grade quality. Works with React, Vue, Taro, and other modern frontend frameworks.

The goal isn't just to find problems — it's to give the user a clear verdict: is this code safe to ship, and if not, what exactly needs fixing?

## When to Use

- Pre-commit self-check
- Pre-PR-review preparation
- Post-refactoring regression check
- Quality assessment when inheriting code
- Post-bug-fix verification

## Checklist

For the full detailed checklist with code examples, see [checklist.md](references/checklist.md).

### 1. Static Analysis (Lint & Fix)

Run lint checks, prioritize fixing `no-unused-vars`, `no-undef`, `exhaustive-deps`. Only fix errors introduced by the current change — don't expand the diff.

### 2. Robustness & Defensive Programming

Key areas:

- **TypeScript**: Complete interfaces, proper optional marking, default values
- **Null safety**: Optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??`
- **Boundary handling**: Empty arrays, division by zero, negative indices
- **Async safety**: try-catch around awaits, loading/error states
- **Race conditions**: AbortController, cancellation flags, disabled buttons during loading

### 3. Context & Side Effects

- **Upstream impact**: When modifying shared components, check all consumers
- **Effect cleanup**: Every `useEffect` subscription must have a cleanup function
- **State pollution**: Never mutate props or global state objects directly
- **Closure traps**: Ensure event callbacks reference the latest state values

### 4. Performance

- Render control: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` where needed
- Frequency control: debounce/throttle for search, scroll, resize
- List rendering: stable, unique `key`
- Code splitting: `React.lazy` for heavy components

### 5. Framework-Specific Checks

- **Vue**: Reactive traps, lifecycle cleanup, computed side effects, v-for + v-if
- **Taro**: API compatibility, subpackage config, setData optimization, lifecycle hooks

## Workflow

```
1. Receive code (specified file or current context)
       ↓
2. Run ESLint check → auto-fix basic errors
       ↓
3. Deep analysis: robustness → side effects → performance
       ↓
4. Generate report with scoring
       ↓
5. Action recommendation: pass / warn / block
```

## Quick Reference

| Problem         | Typical scenario                         | Solution                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Null error      | `Cannot read property of undefined`      | Use `?.` optional chaining         |
| Race condition  | Fast page switching causes data mismatch | AbortController to cancel requests |
| Memory leak     | setState after unmount                   | useEffect cleanup function         |
| Infinite render | useEffect dependency array error         | Check dependency completeness      |
| Performance     | List rendering lag                       | Use key + React.memo               |

### React/Vue Comparison

| Check            | React                       | Vue                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |

| Computed caching | `useMemo`                   | `computed`                       |
| Callback caching | `useCallback`               | Not needed manually              |
| State update     | `setState` / `useState`     | `ref` / `reactive`               |
| Props validation | TypeScript interface        | `props` definition + `validator` |
