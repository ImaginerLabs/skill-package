name: feature-port-doc-generator
description: >-
  Generates standardized porting documentation from completed feature changes. Analyzes commit diffs or file contents,
  extracts change intent, and outputs Markdown documentation for cross-team understanding.
  Should be used when the user needs to document a change for cross-team or cross-project consumption.
  Distinguished from cross-branch-fix-porter which actively re-implements fixes, this skill documents changes.

# Feature Porting Document Generator

## Core Approach

Not copying code — transmitting intent. Let the receiving team understand "what changed, why it changed, and how to implement it in their own project."

## When to Use

- User provides a commit ID that needs to be documented as a porting guide
- User provides one or more changed files and needs to extract the change intent
- A feature implementation needs to be shared with other project teams

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Get Change Information

**Case A: User provided a commit ID**

```
1. Get commit basic info (message, author, time)
2. Get commit code diff
3. Count changed files, assess change scope
```

**Case B: User specified file paths (no commit ID)**

```
1. Read the user-specified file contents
2. Find recent related commit history for those files
3. Confirm the relevant commits and get their diffs
```

### Phase 2: Analyze Change Intent

```
1. [Change type] What kind of change is this? (New feature / Bug fix / Performance optimization / Refactoring)
2. [Problem/Goal] What problem does this change solve, or what goal does it achieve?
3. [Change scope] Which files are involved? What's the purpose of each file's change?
4. [Core logic] What's the key behavioral change (not code change)?
5. [External dependencies] Does the change introduce new dependencies (npm packages, utility functions, components, APIs)?
6. [Porting prerequisites] What baseline conditions must other projects meet before porting?
```

### Phase 3: Collect File Paths

```
1. For file paths in the commit diff, combine with project root to form absolute paths
2. Use git rev-parse --show-toplevel to get the project root
3. All file paths in the final document should use absolute path format
```

### Phase 4: Assess Porting Complexity

| Complexity  | Criteria                                                                      | Porting advice                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Simple**  | Single file change, no new dependencies, independent logic                    | Can directly reference code implementation |
| **Medium**  | Multi-file change, few dependencies, related logic                            | Port file by file in order                 |
| **Complex** | Involves architectural changes, many dependencies, requires prerequisite work | Port in phases                             |

### Phase 5: Generate Porting Document

The document must include these sections:

- Change overview (type, goal, background)
- File scope (file list + change description)
- Core logic explanation (before/after behavior comparison)
- Dependency list (new dependencies, prerequisites)
- Porting steps (step-by-step instructions)
- Notes (common issues, risk points)

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## [Feature Name] Porting Document

### Change Overview

- **Type**: New feature / Bug fix / Performance optimization / Refactoring
- **Goal**: [One-sentence description]
- **Background**: [Why this change was needed]

### File Scope

| File path           | Change description  |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| /abs/path/file1.ts  | [Purpose of change] |
| /abs/path/file2.tsx | [Purpose of change] |

### Core Logic Explanation

**Before**: [Original behavior]

**After**: [New behavior]

### Dependency List

**New dependencies**:

- [Dependency package/utility function/component]

**Prerequisites**:

- [Baseline conditions the project must meet]

### Porting Steps

1. [Step 1: specific action]
2. [Step 2: specific action]
3. [Step 3: specific action]

### Notes

- [Risk point or common issue]
```

## Important Notes

- **Paths must be absolute** — All file paths in the document must use absolute paths
- **Intent over code** — The core of the document is communicating "why it changed"
- **Reader's perspective** — Write for someone who doesn't know the original project
- **Dependencies must be complete** — All newly introduced dependencies must be listed
- **Steps must be executable** — Porting steps must be specific enough to follow
