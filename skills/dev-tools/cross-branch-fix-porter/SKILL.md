  Cross-branch fix porting expert. Understands fix intent and re-implements the same fix goal in the current branch's
  code context when direct cherry-pick isn't feasible.
  Should be used when the user needs to apply a fix from one branch to another where code structures differ
  significantly.
  Distinguished from feature-port-doc-generator which documents changes, this skill actively re-implements fixes.

# Cross-Branch Fix Porting

## Core Approach

**Don't copy code — copy intent.** First understand what problem the fix solves and why it was done that way, then re-implement the same fix goal within the current branch's code logic.

## When to Use

- User provides a commit ID that needs to be ported to the current branch
- Two projects have significantly different structures (different frameworks, different directory layouts)
- Direct cherry-pick would produce many conflicts or logical errors

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Get Fix Information

**Case A: User provided a commit ID**

```
1. Get commit basic info (message, author, time)
2. Get commit code diff
3. Analyze diff, extract fix intent
```

**Case B: From conversation context**

```
1. Search conversation history for fix-related content
2. Extract already-analyzed fix content and intent
```

### Phase 2: Analyze Fix Intent

After reading the diff, answer these questions:

```
1. [Root cause] What bug did this fix solve, or what requirement did it fulfill?
2. [Change scope] Which files are involved? What's the purpose of each file's change?
3. [Core logic] What's the key behavioral change (not code change)?
4. [Dependencies] Does the fix depend on specific utility functions, components, or type definitions?
```

### Phase 3: Locate Corresponding Files in Current Branch

```
1. Based on the functional modules involved in the fix, search for corresponding files in the current branch
2. Read candidate file contents to confirm they handle the same functionality
3. If no corresponding file is found, inform the user and explain why
```

### Phase 4: Determine if Direct Copy is Possible

Direct copy is only appropriate when **all** of these conditions are met:

1. The file in the original commit diff is marked as "new file" (entirely new creation)
2. No file at the same path or with the same functionality exists in the current branch
3. The file content doesn't depend on modules or types that don't exist in the current branch

If conditions are met: copy the file directly.
If not: proceed to Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Re-implement the Fix

**Use the current branch's logic as the source of truth.** Don't copy the original code:

```
1. Read the current branch's corresponding file's complete logic
2. Understand the current branch's code style, encapsulation patterns, utility functions
3. "Translate" the fix intent into the current branch's implementation style
4. If the current branch already has similar logic, modify it in place
```

**Porting principles:**

| Principle                 | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intent first**          | Reproduce the behavioral effect of the fix, not the code             |
| **Respect current style** | Use the current branch's utility functions, types, and encapsulation |
| **Minimal change**        | Only modify what's necessary, don't introduce unrelated changes      |
| **Consistency**           | Match the current branch's code style and conventions                |

## Important Notes

- **Don't blindly copy code** — Original code may depend on utility functions or types that don't exist in the current branch
- **Analyze before acting** — Complete intent analysis before modifying any files
- **Ask when uncertain** — If the intent of a change is ambiguous, confirm with the user
- **Go step by step for large structural differences** — Port core logic first, then handle edge cases
